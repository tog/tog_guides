If you start fresh from tog 0.6 or you were already using edge, migration (if needed) should be small. For those of you using an older version of tog, we have a template for upgrading to tog 0.6 (has been already been used to migrate toghq.com) that will be relased in the coming days.

You can check the changelog for every core plugin for changes:
